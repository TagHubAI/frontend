          protect the safety of any individual, to handle fraud, security, or
          technical issues, or to defend TagHub&#39;s rights or property, Taghub

        <h2 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We might buy or sell assets or company offerings as we grow our
          enterprise. In these kinds of transactions, customer, email, and
          visitor information is typically one of the transferred corporate

          merger, divestiture, or dissolution.

        <h2 id="how-we-protect-your-information">
          How We Protect Your Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          We place a high priority on the security of your information. We use
          secure socket layer technology to encrypt the transmission of
          sensitive data you input as part of our service, such as a credit card
          number (SSL). Your credit card information and other sensitive data
          are not kept on our servers. To provide safe and secure payment
          methods for any transaction, we employ the services of a secure
          payment gateway. Our website never transmits your credit card
          information because the payment gateway is in charge of gathering,
          storing, and encrypting your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we receive your personal information, TagHub uses commercially
          reasonable physical, administrative, and technical precautions to
          maintain its security and integrity. For instance, we frequently and
          continuously back up your data to assist in data recovery and prevent
          data loss. In order to safeguard our network and better protect your
          information, we also take precautions against typical web attack
          vectors and set up firewalls and access controls on our servers.
          However, since there is no 100% secure means of electronic
          transmission or storage, we are unable to guarantee or promise the
          security of any information you communicate or store using the
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the notification procedures outlined in this Privacy
          Policy or as otherwise required by applicable law, TagHub will
          promptly notify those individuals whose personal information has been
          compromised in the event that personal information is compromised as a
          result of a security breach.
